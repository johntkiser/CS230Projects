# CS230Projects
Software Design Document (SDD) created for SNHU Operating Platforms CS230 class. The project was based on an example stand-in client company named The Gaming Room. The client wanted to expand their current Android based game, Draw It or Lose It, to a web based platform which could be used from various other operating platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.

In the development of the software design document, I most enjoyed learning about and developing the flow chart showing the program flow. This part of the process is the most helpful for me I believe when it comes to actually developing the code for the software solution. If I could change anything about my SDD, I would put a little further detail into the Operating System Architetures section. 

It is of utmost importance to meet the needs of the client/user, because at the end of the day, they are the customer and they need their needs to be met. In designing a similar software solution in the future, I would utilize the knowledge and skills learned from this class to develop a SDD prior to beginning coding. In this way I could frame my approach and have a plan of action before even getting started.
